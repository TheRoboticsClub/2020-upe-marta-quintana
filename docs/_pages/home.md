Hello, everybody! Welcome to my Blog! 

I'm Marta Quintana,  

here I am going to put all the advances of my 'URJC Prácticas Externas', and everything I have learned in this process.
I'm working in JdeRobot focusing especially on the ACADEMY project(https://jderobot.github.io/projects/robotics_education/)
Using Docker, Gazebo simulator, ROS and more web technologies.

I hope you enjoy and learn with me,

Regards!

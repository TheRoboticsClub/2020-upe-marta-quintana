Hello! 

This week I have to do some things:

 
- I update RADI to version 0.3.5 adding to the message #gui to send the v and b of the student's car.

- I did the Obstacle avoidance Rectangle Borders & I added odometry to follow line exercise:

   {% include gallery caption=" Obstacle Avoidance Rectangle Bornders & Follow line Speedometer V & W " %}
   
- Odometry Follow line working with RADI 0.3.5

All are in git hub pull resquest and RADI is updated in Docker Hub.

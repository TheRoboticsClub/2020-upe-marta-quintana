Hello! 

This week the first thing I have done was the web page with gh-pages and this is the result! 
Also I have read three articles that my tutor Jose Mar√≠a has sent me about JdeRobotAcademy. I have read some web pages that my tutor Nacho has sent me about Docker and I did a tutorial about Docker and tecnology Flask (to serve a web page).
I installed apps and programs I need for work.
Other task  I had to do was using academy with the exercise follows line and I have also been able to test it online with academy-online.

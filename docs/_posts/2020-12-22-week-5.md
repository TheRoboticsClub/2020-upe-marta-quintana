Hello!

This week I have to do some things:

-  I have to improve the frontend of the webpage of unibotics first with Robotics Academy offline and here you can see what i made:

- Making work again unibotics-webserver: the problem was with the version latest of RADI, it isn't sending nothing and it didn't work, best docker jderobot RADI for follow line v0.2.5

- Widget/Automatic Evaluator: We will solve this step later, due to the changes that the platform is undergoing.

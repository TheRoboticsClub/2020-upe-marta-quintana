Hello! 

This week I have to do some things:

-  Automatic Evaluator Follow line: I did a percentage bar with circuit percentage with 60 check points,I have taken the checkpoints by hand because the ones we had were not correct.
    The position of the car and with the check points, the Euclidean distance is calculated. It compares with point one, if the distance is short increases the percentage, and then compares the car position with the second checkpoint and in this way it does not have to check all points all the time.
   I have also added the number of the lap and and the time it took.

- Starting with Automatic evaluator obstacle avoidance

- I also studied the way to add in minimal mistakes a tag or other botton with the version but its not posible, also i tried to add the version in the photo with this templates but it only works in header images.
  so we can add the version in the explanation of the exercise and in the button we can put 'active/go' or ' prototipe'

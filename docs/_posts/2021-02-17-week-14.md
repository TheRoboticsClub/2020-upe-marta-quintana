Hello! 

This week I have to do some things:
- Solving mistakes: I fix Load VC_loc Button, also the reset boton for update the obstacle avoidance evaluator, clean the bird-eye canvas of the Vacuum cleaner when reset, and a little bug in html.
Now all works great!!

- Today is my last day and here is the final Frontend of Unibotics exercises, with the improvements and adding widgets of evaluators!! 
I hope you like!

Thanks for all!

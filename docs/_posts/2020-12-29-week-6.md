Hello! Merry Christmas!

This week I have to do some things:

-  I have to improve the last frontend of the webpage  Robotics Academy offline with Boostrap and other changes:

{% include gallery caption="New Frontend v.2  Robotics Academy offline " %}

- I made 2 incidences in unibotics-exercises and by the next week I'll have the new frontend of the follow line in unibotics. Because Jorge and David were making the last changes to make it work. Now I have unibotics-webserver with unibotics-exercises working in my computer.

- Widget/Automatic Evaluator: I will try this week with Nacho & Sergio Paniego . Nacho send me today the check points.

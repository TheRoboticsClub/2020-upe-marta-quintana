Hello!

This week I have done some things:

- I made two videos for Unibotics 
   One of Unibotics 'Online' or 'Remote'
   <iframe width="150" height="100" src="https://youtube.com/embed/ooY9dv1WoWQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
   
   
   And the other about Unibotics Local with Docker
   <iframe width="150" height="100" src="https://youtube.com/embed/wuW5V0TNS3Q" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
   
   
- I made the Installation instructions for users main page 'How to use Unibotics' :
  {% include gallery caption="'HOW TO USE UNIBOTICS' Installations instructions for users " %}
 
 
- Bettatesting Academy 'normal' Ros Gazebo 2.3 WebTemplates --> 2.3 WebTemplates works but I can't put the follow line code yet. First I'm trying the follow_line code with ROSnode. Unibotics, WebTemplates and Rosnode ACADEMY works but no with the follow line. Now I understand better JdeRobot Academy versions.  


- Trying to understand the exercise's code in host.py and page.html --> follow_line index.html and host.py I have seen the code and I have a small perspective of how works.

Hello!

This week I have done some things:

-  I've made some big changes to the Nacho's code to make it work, now it does a lap in 6 minutes, but it detects the line correctly what is the main objective.

- Versions in GitHub :
  Version number  MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
    MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
    MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and  (Adding functionality)
    PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes. (Solving errors)
    
    Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
    
    I practise in one of my repositories how to do a releases(github versions).
    
- Studying unibotics-webserver code: I see the repository and  I understand more or less how works.
